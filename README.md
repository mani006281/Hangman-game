This Hangman game is a fun, text-based Python program where the player guesses a hidden word one letter at a time. The game randomly selects a word from a list of five and displays blank spaces for each letter. The player has six chances to guess wrong. For each correct letter, it reveals all matching positions. The code uses basic Python concepts like lists, strings, loops, conditionals, and user input to manage the game flow. It's simple, beginner-friendly, and runs in the console, making it a great way to practice logical thinking and Python fundamentals in an interactive way.
